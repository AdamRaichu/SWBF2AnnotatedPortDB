A database of entities and their ports with user-created documentation.

## About

This project takes a list of entities and their hashed ports (generated using tools from Mophead01/FrostyToolsuite1063), replaces hashes with strings from MagixGames/SWBF2HashDatabase (if available), and outputs a file formatted according to `schema.json`.

## Repository Structure

**raw**: The file listing the names of entities and their ports (as used by the vanilla game).

**HashDb**: A git submodule to Magix's DB of strings.

**docs**: List of JSON files that contain the actual documentation of ports.

**generated**: The output file generated by... :down_arrow:

**generator**: A NodeJS script that merges user documentation with raw data and outputs built files.

**publish**: A python script that pushes the built file to swbf2frosty.wiki.gg. TODO: Unimplemented.
